      Driver used to execute the query.
  - name: query
    type: keyword
    description: |
      Query executed to collect metrics.
  - name: metrics.database_id
    type: long
    description: |
      Unique ID of the database inside MSSQL.
  - name: metrics.database_name
    type: keyword
    description: |
      Name of the database.
  - name: metrics.page splits/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Number of page splits per second that occur as the result of overflowing index pages.
  - name: metrics.lock waits/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Number of lock requests per second that required the caller to wait.
  - name: metrics.user connections
    type: long
    description: |
      Total number of user connections.
  - name: metrics.active temp tables
    type: long
    description: |
      Number of temporary tables/table variables in use.
  - name: metrics.transactions
    type: long
    description: |
      Total number of transactions
  - name: metrics.Connection Reset/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Total number of logins started from the connection pool.
  - name: metrics.logins/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Total number of logins started per second. This does not include pooled connections.
  - name: metrics.logouts/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Total number of logout operations started per second.
  - name: metrics.sql re-compilations/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Number of statement recompiles per second. Counts the number of times statement recompiles are triggered. Generally, you want the recompiles to be low.
  - name: metrics.sql compilations/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Number of SQL compilations per second. Indicates the number of times the compile code path is entered. Includes compiles caused by statement-level recompilations in SQL Server. After SQL Server user activity is stable, this value reaches a steady state.
  - name: metrics.batch requests/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Number of Transact-SQL command batches received per second. This statistic is affected by all constraints (such as I/O, number of users, cache size, complexity of requests, and so on). High batch requests mean good throughput.
  - name: metrics.buffer cache hit ratio
    type: double
    description: |
      The ratio is the total number of cache hits divided by the total number of cache lookups over the last few thousand page accesses. After a long period of time, the ratio moves very little. Because reading from the cache is much less expensive than reading from disk, you want this ratio to be high.
  - name: metrics.page life expectancy
    type: long
    description: |
      Indicates the number of seconds a page will stay in the buffer pool without references (in seconds).
  - name: metrics.checkpoint pages/sec
    type: long
    description: |
      Indicates the number of pages flushed to disk per second by a checkpoint or other operation that require all dirty pages to be flushed.
  - name: metrics.database pages
    type: long
    description: |
      Indicates the number of pages in the buffer pool with database content.
  - name: metrics.target pages
    type: long
    description: |
      Ideal number of pages in the buffer pool.
